# [v0.5](https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/releases/tag/v0.5) (2025-06-29)

## Added
- Development Guide for contributors ([#31](https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/issues/31))
- `banner.png` (`logo.png` looked bad on the social preview)
- Configuration overhaul ([#30](https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/issues/30))
  - All settings have defaults now
  - Settings can be changed dynamically with `set/2` and `add/2`
  - `reload_config/0` re-reads config file
  - `dump_settings/2` dumps current setting values to a file, all or only those that differ from the defaults
- Check for documentation comments in `check_all.sh`
- Build and release overhaul ([#105](https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/issues/105))
  - Releases now also ship `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, docs and the default config, not just the binaries
  - `generate_release.sh` for easy release generation

## Changed
- Configuration overhaul ([#30](https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/issues/30))
  - It is loaded at runtime, i.e. `config.pl` is no longer compiled in
  - Default config is installed to `/etc/plwm/config.pl` (uninstall won't remove, reinstall backs it up if changed)
  - **Existing configs must remove the `:- module` declaration line**
  - **`bar_class/2` had been changed to a deterministic `bar_classes/1` taking a list of pairs**
- Minor code and docs refactors (e.g. all binaries and objects go to `bin/` now, fixing broken links, etc.)
